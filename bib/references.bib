@article{Beck2016Visual,
	abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

	abstract = {the tools that botanists require for field-work must evolve and take on new forms. Of particular importance is the ability to identify existing and new species in the field. Mobile augmented reality systems can make it possible to access, view, and inspect a large database of virtual species examples side-by-side with physical specimens. In this paper, we present prototypes of a mobile augmented reality electronic field guide and techniques for displaying and inspecting computer vision-based visual search results in the form of virtual vouchers. Our work addresses head-movement controlled augmented reality for hands-free interaction and tangible augmented reality. We describe results from our design and investigation process and discuss observations and feedback from lab trials by botanists.},

  Visualizations in real world environments benefit from the visual interaction between real and virtual imagery. However, compared to traditional visualizations, a number of problems have to be solved in order to achieve effective visualizations within Augmented Reality (AR). This chapter provides an overview of techniques to handle the main obstacles in AR visualizations. It discusses spatial integration of virtual objects within real world environments, techniques to rearrange objects within mixed environments, and visualizations which adapt to its environmental context.},
