  abstract = {We introduce a visualization which has been designed to create a Fingerprint of a product, and have applied this to the nutritional data in food items. This visualization allows customers to compare the data in a Nutrition Facts Panel between two different food items. It is becoming increasingly common for people to seek information so they can make more informed decisions about their diet. One such method is by reading the Nutrition Facts Panel on a product's packaging. However, the information presented is inconsistent between products, and thus, is difficult to compare. To help people make the necessary comparisons, we created the Fingerprint, a vi-sualization designed to help customers find suitable food items by enabling direct comparison of nutritional data in food items.},

A key feature of the Shifted Maps visualization is the possibility to explore the data in three different arrangements based on geo-spatial position, travel time, and frequency of movements. By combining map and network visualizations of movement data, it becomes possible to analyze and compare spatial and temporal topologies.},

  abstract = {Data visualization and analytics research has great potential to empower people to improve their lives by leveraging their own personal data. However, most quantified selfers (Q-Selfers) are neither visualization experts nor data scientists. Consequently, visualizations Q-Selfers created with their data are often not ideal for conveying insights. Aiming to design a visualization system to help nonexperts gain and comμnicate personal data insights, the authors conducted a predesign empirical study. Through the lens of Q-Selfers, they examined what insights people gain specifically from their personal data and how they use visualizations to communicate their insights. Based on their analysis of 30 quantified self-presentations, they characterized eight insight types (detail, self-reflection, trend, comparison, correlation, data summary, distribution, and outlier) and mapped the visual annotations used to communicate them. They further discussed four areas for the design of personal visualization systems, including support for encouraging self-reflection, gaining valid insight, comμnicating insight, and using visual annotations.},

Hence, in this paper we focus on the use of Data Memes for this purpose and also explain how they can be constructed with relative ease. Data Memes as a general concept are meant to engage users with the visualization and persuade a viewer to look at the data. Communicating personal achievements is often the wish of posters in social networks, and although we have not tested this yet, we believe that Data Memes augmented with pertinent personal data have good potential to achieve higher levels of attention in these circles, and elsewhere.},

We specifically investigate how information visualizations support the players' data comprehension, and how their level of comprehension might depend on factors such as their general literacy, visualization literacy and maturity. We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples' use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples' level of visualization literacy.},

A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the three visualizations based on participants' task performance and self-reported experience. The results showed that in objective terms, there were not significant differences in participants' time spent on the task and their error rates across the three visualizations. However, in subjective terms, participants did perceive the visualizations differently. The pragmatic bar chart won on several attributes (readability, comprehension, and awareness), and the Virtual Pet visualization triggered an emotional response (empathy). Although the Circular Ringmap visualization helped participants with identifying activity patterns, it was not perceived to be intuitive or helpful overall. From this study, first, we learned that how people perform a task does not equal how participants perceive. Second, decisions in designing specific visualizations related to personal data should depend each individual goals and contexts. Last, the role of emotion, which was triggered by the design of visualizations, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in mobile augmented reality (AR) techniques have shed new light on personal visualization for their advantages of fitting visualization within personal routines, situating visualization in a real-world context, and arousing users' interests. However, enabling non-experts to create data visualization in mobile AR environments is challenging given the lack of tools that allow in-situ design while supporting the binding of data to AR content. Most existing AR authoring tools require working on personal computers or manually creating each virtual object and modifying its visual attributes. We systematically study this issue by identifying the specificity of AR glyph-based visualization authoring tool and distill four design considerations. Following these design considerations, we design and implement MARVisT, a mobile authoring tool that leverages information from reality to assist non-experts in addressing relationships between data and virtual glyphs, real objects and virtual glyphs, and real objects and data. With MARVisT, users without visualization expertise can bind data to real-world objects to create expressive AR glyph-based visualizations rapidly and effortlessly, reshaping the representation of the real world with data. We use several examples to demonstrate the expressiveness of MARVisT. A user study with non-experts is also conducted to evaluate the authoring experience of MARVisT.},

But, data focusing on their personal learning is lacking, as it does not get updated regularly (being updated at the end of a taught session) and the displayed information is generally a single grade. Consequently, it is difficult for students to use this information to adapt their behavior, and help them on their learning journey. Yet, there is a rich set of data that could be captured and help students learn better. What is required is dynamically, regularly updated personal data, that is displayed to students in a timely way. Such 'personal data' can be presented to the student through 'personal visualizations' that engender 'personal learning'. In this paper we discuss our journey into developing learning systems and our resulting experience with learners. We present a vision, to integrate new technologies and visualization solutions, in order to encourage and develop personal learning that employs the visualization of personal learning data.},

From our previous research, we learned that people see many opportunities for sharing personal notes, for example among a small social group. Yet, people reported that they were hesitant to share raw notes due to the notes' often disorganized structure, haphazard writing style, or due to the fact that notes may contain a number of unrelated or irrelevant pieces of information. In this paper, we discuss how word-scale visualizations can be used in a collaborative personal visualization setting-to show abstracted information from a shared set of notes in the context of personal note-taking. In particular, we discuss potential kinds of data about notes that can be shared and motivate why sharing them may be helpful. Additionally, we provide two examples that illustrate the challenges and implications of using word-scale visualizations to share data in notes. The first example describes how notes in a shared notebook can be combined with private notes. The second example shows how data from public sources can be mixed with private comments to support sharing between notes on a common topic.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, with the availability of massive amounts of personal data, the role of Information Visualization is getting more and more important. There are a lot of visualization and visual analytics tools to help people to make sense of their personal data in their everyday lives. There is a consensus in the visualization community about the importance of user engagement for personal visual analytics. However, there are many challenges associated with this topic. As of yet, there is no clear and widely accepted definition for user engagement. Consequently and despite some recent efforts, there are no systematic and unified methods for evaluating different aspects of user engagement. In this paper, we bring attention to some fundamental open issues in the context of Information Visualization: What is the definition of engagement? What are the levels of engagement? How to measure engagement? How to improve user engagement level? This research is an initial attempt towards addressing some of these issues. Our main goal is to enable visualization researchers to more accurately measure and evaluate user engagement with visualizations. To this end, we reviewed definitions, measures, and frameworks from various other disciplines and specified the gap in the visualization community. We propose a five level taxonomy for engagement which is deeply inspired by Boloom’s Taxonomy. In addition, we address some important open questions that require further exploration. This paper establishes a groundwork for future research in user engagement with visualizations.},

Four cooperated visualization views and many interactions are provided in this tool to visually explore the temporal features of various interactive events between smartphones and their users, the hierarchical associations among event types, and the detailed distributions ofmassive event sequences. In the case studies, plenty of interesting patterns are discovered by analyzing the data of two smartphone users with different usage styles.},

  title={Enhancing cyber situation awareness for non-expert users using visual analytics},
  author={Legg, Philip A},
  abstract = {Situation awareness is often described as the perception and comprehension of the current situation, and the projection of future status. Whilst this may be understood in an organisational cybersecurity context, there is a strong case to be made for effective cybersecurity situation awareness that is tailored to the needs of the Non-Expert User (NEU). Our online usage habits are rapidly evolving with smartphones and tablets being widely used to access resources online. In order for NEUs to remain safe online, there is a need to enhance awareness and understanding of cybersecurity concerns, such as how devices may be acting online, and what data is being shared between devices. In this paper, we explore the notion of personal situation awareness for NEUs. We conduct a small-scale study to understand how NEUs perceive cybersecurity. We also propose how visual analytics could be used to help encourage NEUs to actively monitor and observe their activity for greater online awareness. The guidance developed through the course of this work can help practitioners develop tools that could help NEUs better understand their online actions, with the aim to result in safer experiences when acting online.},

  abstract = {Motivation is a key factor for introducing and maintaining healthy changes in behaviour. However, typical visualization methods (e.g., bar-, pie-, and line charts) hardly motivate individuals. We investigate how a plant-a living visualization-whose health relies on the plant owner's level of activity, can engage people in tracking and self-reflecting on their fitness data. To address this question, we designed, implemented, and studied Go & Grow, a living plant that receives water proportionally to its owner's activity. Our six-week qualitative study with ten participants suggests that living visual-izations have qualities that their digital counterparts do not have. This includes people feeling: emotionally connected to their plant; sentiments such as pride and guilt; and responsibility towards their plant. Based on this study, we introduce the Goal Motivation Model, a model considering the diversity of individuals, thus supporting and encouraging a diversity of strategies for accomplishing goals.},
