        "abstract": "Corporate meetings are a crucial part of business activities. While numerous academic papers investigated how to make the scheduling process of meetings faster or even automatic, little work has been done yet to facilitate the retrospective reasoning about how time is spent on meetings. Traditional calendar applications do not allow users to extract actionable statistics although it has been shown that reflection-oriented design can increase the users' understanding of their habits and can thereby encourage a shift towards better practices. In this paper, we present MineTime Insight, a tool made of multiple coordinated views for the exploration of personal calendar data, with the overarching goal of improving short and long-term scheduling decisions. Despite being focused on the working environment, our work builds upon recent results in the field of Personal Visual Analytics, as it targets users not necessarily expert in visualization and data analysis. We demonstrate the potential of MineTime Insight, when applied to the agenda of an executive manager. Finally, we discuss the results of an informal user study and a field study. Our results suggest that our visual representations are perceived as easy to understand and helpful towards a change in the scheduling habits.",

        "abstract": "We present Activity River, a personal visualization tool which enables individuals to plan, log, and reflect on their self-defined activities. We are interested in supporting this type of reflective practice as prior work has shown that reflection can help people plan and manage their time effectively. Hence, we designed Activity River based on five design goals (visualize historical and contextual data, facilitate comparison of goals and achievements, engage viewers with delightful visuals, support authorship, and enable flexible planning and logging) which we distilled from the Information Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction literature. To explore our approach's strengths and limitations, we conducted a qualitative study of Activity River using a role-playing method. Through this qualitative exploration, we illustrate how our participants envisioned using our visualization to perform dynamic and continuous reflection on their activities. We observed that they were able to assess their progress towards their plans and adapt to unforeseen circumstances using our tool.",

However, typical visualization methods (e.g., bar-, pie-, and line charts) hardly motivate individuals. We investigate how a plant-a living visualization-whose health relies on the plant owner's level of activity, can engage people in tracking and self-reflecting on their fitness data. To address this question, we designed, implemented, and studied Go & Grow, a living plant that receives water proportionally to its owner's activity. Our six-week qualitative study with ten participants suggests that living visual-izations have qualities that their digital counterparts do not have. This includes people feeling: emotionally connected to their plant; sentiments such as pride and guilt; and responsibility towards their plant. Based on this study, we introduce the Goal Motivation Model, a model considering the diversity of individuals, thus supporting and encouraging a diversity of strategies for accomplishing goals.",

Personal stories are often subjective and storytellers omit, make up, or embellish details to craft engaging stories or to communicate a perspective. As growing personal data collections allow individuals to leverage visualizations, we explore how personal visual narratives can express subjectivity. From an analysis of personal visualizations created by data enthusiasts, designers and artists, we collect techniques for deliberately expressing subjectivity during data collection, processing, visual encoding, and presentation. Our results prompt a discussion about the role and potential of subjectivity in personal visual storytelling.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in mobile augmented reality (AR) techniques have shed new light on personal visualization for their advantages of fitting visualization within personal routines, situating visualization in a real-world context, and arousing users' interests. However, enabling non-experts to create data visualization in mobile AR environments is challenging given the lack of tools that allow in-situ design while supporting the binding of data to AR content. Most existing AR authoring tools require working on personal computers or manually creating each virtual object and modifying its visual attributes. We systematically study this issue by identifying the specificity of AR glyph-based visualization authoring tool and distill four design considerations. Following these design considerations, we design and implement MARVisT, a mobile authoring tool that leverages information from reality to assist non-experts in addressing relationships between data and virtual glyphs, real objects and virtual glyphs, and real objects and data. With MARVisT, users without visualization expertise can bind data to real-world objects to create expressive AR glyph-based visualizations rapidly and effortlessly, reshaping the representation of the real world with data. We use several examples to demonstrate the expressiveness of MARVisT. A user study with non-experts is also conducted to evaluate the authoring experience of MARVisT.",

Consequently, visualizations Q-Selfers created with their data are often not ideal for conveying insights. Aiming to design a visualization system to help nonexperts gain and com\u03bcnicate personal data insights, the authors conducted a predesign empirical study. Through the lens of Q-Selfers, they examined what insights people gain specifically from their personal data and how they use visualizations to communicate their insights. Based on their analysis of 30 quantified self-presentations, they characterized eight insight types (detail, self-reflection, trend, comparison, correlation, data summary, distribution, and outlier) and mapped the visual annotations used to communicate them. They further discussed four areas for the design of personal visualization systems, including support for encouraging self-reflection, gaining valid insight, com\u03bcnicating insight, and using visual annotations.",

Since Data Memes can represent very personal views, it is natural to employ them in the visualization of personal data. Hence, in this paper we focus on the use of Data Memes for this purpose and also explain how they can be constructed with relative ease. Data Memes as a general concept are meant to engage users with the visualization and persuade a viewer to look at the data. Communicating personal achievements is often the wish of posters in social networks, and although we have not tested this yet, we believe that Data Memes augmented with pertinent personal data have good potential to achieve higher levels of attention in these circles, and elsewhere.",

From our previous research, we learned that people see many opportunities for sharing personal notes, for example among a small social group. Yet, people reported that they were hesitant to share raw notes due to the notes' often disorganized structure, haphazard writing style, or due to the fact that notes may contain a number of unrelated or irrelevant pieces of information. In this paper, we discuss how word-scale visualizations can be used in a collaborative personal visualization setting-to show abstracted information from a shared set of notes in the context of personal note-taking. In particular, we discuss potential kinds of data about notes that can be shared and motivate why sharing them may be helpful. Additionally, we provide two examples that illustrate the challenges and implications of using word-scale visualizations to share data in notes. The first example describes how notes in a shared notebook can be combined with private notes. The second example shows how data from public sources can be mixed with private comments to support sharing between notes on a common topic.",

We specifically investigate how information visualizations support the players' data comprehension, and how their level of comprehension might depend on factors such as their general literacy, visualization literacy and maturity. We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples' use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples' level of visualization literacy.",

The on-calendar visualization enabled people to quickly identify and reason about regular patterns and anomalies. Based on our results, we also derived a model of the behavior feedback process that extends existing technology adoption models. With that, we reflected on potential barriers for the ongoing use of feedback tools.",

Our online usage habits are rapidly evolving with smartphones and tablets being widely used to access resources online. In order for NEUs to remain safe online, there is a need to enhance awareness and understanding of cybersecurity concerns, such as how devices may be acting online, and what data is being shared between devices. In this paper, we explore the notion of personal situation awareness for NEUs. We conduct a small-scale study to understand how NEUs perceive cybersecurity. We also propose how visual analytics could be used to help encourage NEUs to actively monitor and observe their activity for greater online awareness. The guidance developed through the course of this work can help practitioners develop tools that could help NEUs better understand their online actions, with the aim to result in safer experiences when acting online.",

There are a lot of visualization and visual analytics tools to help people to make sense of their personal data in their everyday lives. There is a consensus in the visualization community about the importance of user engagement for personal visual analytics. However, there are many challenges associated with this topic. As of yet, there is no clear and widely accepted definition for user engagement. Consequently and despite some recent efforts, there are no systematic and unified methods for evaluating different aspects of user engagement. In this paper, we bring attention to some fundamental open issues in the context of Information Visualization: What is the definition of engagement? What are the levels of engagement? How to measure engagement? How to improve user engagement level? This research is an initial attempt towards addressing some of these issues. Our main goal is to enable visualization researchers to more accurately measure and evaluate user engagement with visualizations. To this end, we reviewed definitions, measures, and frameworks from various other disciplines and specified the gap in the visualization community. We propose a five level taxonomy for engagement which is deeply inspired by Boloom\u2019s Taxonomy. In addition, we address some important open questions that require further exploration.

This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people engaging with and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, what we call the personal informatics analysis gap. We explore this gap through a multistage longitudinal study on how asthmatics engage with personal air quality data, and we report how participants: were motivated by broad and diverse goals; exhibited patterns in the way they explored their data; engaged with their data in playful ways; discovered new insights through serendipitous exploration; and were reluctant to use analysis tools on their own.

Visualization is a key means of bridging this gap, however, most approaches to visualization neglect individual differences, and focus instead on one-size-fits-all approaches. One proposed solution to this problem is adaptive visualization. To produce appropriate adaptive visualization tools, however, we must understand the relationship between a user's context and the visualization they require. In this paper, we present a study designed to understand the effects of visualizations that are mismatched, in terms of granularity, to user contexts. We show that users are able to interpret data visualizations most accurately and quickly when the information granularity of the visualization they are shown matches their need for detail and we discuss the consequences of mismatching the information granularity of a visualization to a user's information needs.

ABSTRACT We present a hybrid visualization technique that integrates maps into network visualizations to reveal and analyze diverse topolo-gies in geospatial movement data. With the rise of GPS tracking in various contexts such as smartphones and vehicles there has been a drastic increase in geospatial data being collect for personal reflection and organizational optimization. The generated movement datasets contain both geographical and temporal information, from which rich relational information can be derived. Common map vi-sualizations perform especially well in revealing basic spatial patterns , but pay less attention to more nuanced relational properties. In contrast, network visualizations represent the specific topologi-cal structure of a dataset through the visual connections of nodes and their positioning. So far there has been relatively little research on combining these two approaches. Shifted Maps aims to bring maps and network visualizations together as equals. The visual-ization of places shown as circular map extracts and movements between places shown as edges, can be analyzed in different network arrangements, which reveal spatial and temporal topologies of movement data. We implemented a web-based prototype and report on challenges and opportunities about a novel network layout of places gathered during a qualitative evaluation.",

Yet, there is a rich set of data that could be captured and help students learn better. What is required is dynamically, regularly updated personal data, that is displayed to students in a timely way. Such 'personal data' can be presented to the student through 'personal visualizations' that engender 'personal learning'. In this paper we discuss our journey into developing learning systems and our resulting experience with learners. We present a vision, to integrate new technologies and visualization solutions, in order to encourage and develop personal learning that employs the visualization of personal learning data.",

        "abstract": "Much of the visualization literature focuses on assessment of visual representations with regard to their effectiveness for understanding data. In the present work, we instead focus on making data visualization experiences more enjoyable, to foster deeper engagement with data. We investigate two strategies to make visualization experiences more enjoyable and engaging: personalization, and immersion. We selected pictographs (composed of multiple data glyphs) as this representation affords creative freedom, allowing people to craft symbolic or whimsical shapes of personal significance to represent data. We present the results of a qualitative study with 12 participants crafting pictographs using a large pen-enabled device and while immersed within a VR environment. Our results indicate that personalization and immersion both have positive impact on making visualizations more enjoyable experiences.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of pervasive social networks and social communication media, people are connected all the time and messages arrive endlessly on their devices, generating an enormous quantity of personal content, such as: textual messages, photos, audio clips and videos. However, when an individual desires to go back in the time, recalling or reflecting on what happened months ago about his/her conversation with friends, he/she needs to continuously frenzy scroll over all the past messages and so far there is no visualisation support that can help in recalling personal chats. This work contributes in the emerging field of the Personal Visual Analytics, introducing the Linear-time diagrams, a combination of linear diagram along with a time line, to easily identify 'who interacted with whom and what topic' in a particular period of time. Since, there are no specific tools to visualise and represent set relationships (friendships through messages) over time, but there are many well-known set visualisation tools (without time consideration), such as Euler diagrams, Venn diagrams, Linear diagrams, Spherule diagrams etc. This paper merges Linear diagrams for their scalability in representing set relationships and time-series to represent sequence of events occurred over a period of time to glint the novelty. A prototype tool has been developed, using an anonymous Facebook chat log from the wild. We conducted a workshop with social media users to gain insights about the existing social media without visualisation support and how our visualisation aims in supporting it. The outcomes of the preliminary workshop will help us in enhancing the tool with user-interactions and also consider gestalt principles, perceptual and cognitive theories to navigate easily, analyse and interpret data efficiently.",

They are a vital part of many behavior change technologies (BCT) and Personal Informatics tools. Feedback can be presented in various ways, for example using counts and graphs, stylized displays, metaphoric displays, narrative information, data physicalisations, or even living plants. The properties of a PV are likely to influence its effectiveness towards reaching a goal. However, users\u2019 perceptions and preferences regarding different PVs seem to vary strongly, rendering a one-size-fits-all approach unsuitable. To investigate whether preferences for certain PVs coincide with personality or gender, we conducted a lab study with three example PVs: Donut, Glass, and Creature. Indeed, the results of our lab study are a first indicator that there is a relationship between personality traits and preferences for different PVs. High scores on extraversion and openness, for example, positively correlated with a preference for Creature. In contrast, high scores in conscientiousness negatively correlated with a preference for Creature. Further research is necessary to better understand how truly personalized PVs can be realized, which, in turn, might fit better into people\u2019s lives and thereby be more effective.",

At the same time, recent work in data ethics cautions that standardized models can have unintended negative consequences for some user groups. Through collaborative design and critical visual analysis, this study contrasts conventional visualizations of personal data with the ways that vulnerable populations represent their lived experiences. Participants self-tracked to manage bipolar disorder, a mental illness characterized by severe and unpredictable mood changes. During design sessions, each created a series of timeline drawings depicting their experiences with mental health. Examples of adaptive and vernacular design, these images use both normative standards and individualized graphic modifications. Analysis shows that conventional visual encodings can support facets of self-assessment while also imposing problematic normative standards onto deeply personal experiences.",

We define visual mementos as visualizations of personally relevant data for the purpose of reminiscing, and sharing of life experiences. Today more people collect digital information about their life than ever before. The shift from physical to digital archives poses new challenges and opportunities for self-reflection and self-representation. Drawing on research on autobiographical memory and on the role of artifacts in reminiscing, we identified design challenges for visual mementos: mapping data to evoke familiarity, expressing subjectivity, and obscuring sensitive details for sharing. Visual mementos can make use of the known strengths of visualization in revealing patterns to show the familiar instead of the unexpected, and extend representational mappings beyond the objective to include the more subjective. To understand whether people's subjective views on their past can be reflected in a visual representation, we developed, deployed and studied a technology probe that exemplifies our concept of visual mementos. Our results show how reminiscing has been supported and reveal promising new directions for self-reflection and sharing through visual mementos of personal experiences.",

The results showed that in objective terms, there were not significant differences in participants' time spent on the task and their error rates across the three visualizations. However, in subjective terms, participants did perceive the visualizations differently. The pragmatic bar chart won on several attributes (readability, comprehension, and awareness), and the Virtual Pet visualization triggered an emotional response (empathy). Although the Circular Ringmap visualization helped participants with identifying activity patterns, it was not perceived to be intuitive or helpful overall. From this study, first, we learned that how people perform a task does not equal how participants perceive. Second, decisions in designing specific visualizations related to personal data should depend each individual goals and contexts. Last, the role of emotion, which was triggered by the design of visualizations, is discussed.",
