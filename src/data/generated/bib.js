        "abstract": " Visual video analytics research, stemming from data captured by surveillance cameras, have mainly focused on traditional computing paradigms, despite emerging platforms including mobile devices. We investigate the potential for situated video analytics, which involves the inspection of video data in the actual environment where the video was captured [14]. Our ultimate goal is to explore the means to visually explore video data effectively, in situated contexts. We first investigate the performance of visual analytic tasks in situated vs. non-situated settings. We find that participants largely benefit from environmental cues for many analytic tasks. We then pose the question of how best to represent situated video data. To answer this, in a design session we explore end-users\u2019 views on how to capture such data. Through the process of sketching, participants leveraged being situated, and explored how being in-situ influenced the participants\u2019 integration of their designs. Based on these two elements, our paper proposes the need to develop novel spatial analytic user interfaces to support situated video analysis.",

        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers. Technologies like lightweight wireless displays, mixed reality hardware, and autonomous vehicles are making it increasingly easier to display data in-context. While researchers and artists have already begun to create embedded data representations, the benefits, trade-offs, and even the language necessary to describe and compare these approaches remain unexplored. In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical data referents - the real-world entities and spaces to which data corresponds - and examine the relationship between referents and the visual and physical representations of their data. We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations. We also examine the tradeoffs between non-situated, situated, and embedded data displays, including both visualizations and physicalizations. Based on our observations, we identify a variety of design challenges for embedded data representation, and suggest opportunities for future research and applications.",

Designing situated visualizations requires a fine-grained understanding of the context in which the visualizations are placed, as well as an exploration of different options for placement and form factors, which existing methods for visualization design do not account for. Focusing on small displays as a target platform, we reflect on our experiences of using a diverse range of sketching activities, materials, and prompts. Based on these observations, we identify challenges and opportunities for sketching and ideating situated visualizations. We also outline the space of design activities for situated visualization and highlight promising methods for both designers and researchers.",

        "abstract": "Today, the widespread use of mobile devices allows users to search information \"on the go\", whenever and wherever they want, no longer confining Information Retrieval to classic desktop interfaces. We believe that technical advances in Augmented Reality will allow Information Retrieval to go even further, making use of both the users' surroundings and their abilities to interact with the physical world. In this paper, we present the fundamental concept of Reality-Based Information Retrieval, which combines the classic Information Retrieval process with Augmented Reality technologies to provide context-dependent search cues and situated visualizations of the query and the results. With information needs often stemming from real-world experiences, this novel combination has the potential to better support both Just-in-time Information Retrieval and serendipity. Based on extensive literature research, we propose a conceptual framework for Reality-Based Information Retrieval. We illustrate and discuss this framework and present two prototypical implementations, which we tested in small user studies. They demonstrate the feasibility of our concepts and inspired our discussion of notable challenges for further research in this novel and promising area.",

        "abstract": "In recent years augmented reality applications have been increasingly demonstrating the requirement for an interaction with information related to and directly shown in the surrounding environment. Situated information is visualized in its semantic and spatial context, building up an environment enhanced by an information level that dynamically adapts to the production of the information and to the actions of the user. The exploration and manipulation of this type of data through see-through augmented reality devices still represents a challenging task. The development of specific interaction strategies capable to mitigating the current limitations of augmented reality devices is essential. In this context, our contribution has been to design possible solutions to address some of these challenges allowing a dynamic interaction with situated information. Following the visual \"information-seeking mantra\" proposed by Shneiderman and introducing some \"superpowers\" for the users, in this work we present different strategies aimed at obtaining an overview and filtering, and acquiring details of a collection of situated data.",

To address these issues, we design an environment that seamlessly integrates all steps of a design and deployment workflow through its main features: i) an extension to Vega, ii) a preview, and iii) debug hints that facilitate valid combinations of static and augmented content. We inform our design through a design space with four ways to augment static visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our tool through examples, including books, posters, projections, wall-sized visualizations. A user study shows high user satisfaction of our environment and confirms that participants can create augmented visualizations in an average of 4.63 minutes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the role of physical scale models in the architectural design process and apply insights from architecture for the creation and use of data physicalizations. Based on a survey of the architecture literature on model making and ten interviews with practicing architects, we describe the role of physical models as a tool for exploration and communication. From these observations, we identify trends in the use of physical models in architecture, which have the potential to inform the design of data physicalizations. We identify four functions of architectural modeling that can be directly adapted for use in the process of building rich data models. Finally, we discuss how the visualization community can apply observations from architecture to the design of new data physicalizations.",

        "abstract": "Public displays are often strongly situated signs deeply embedded in their physical, social, and cultural setting. Understanding how the display is coupled with on-going situations, its level of situatedness, provides a key element for the interpretation of the displays themselves but is also an element for the interpretation of place, its situated practices, and its social context. Most digital displays, however, do not achieve the same sense of situatedness that seems so natural in their nondigital counterparts. This paper investigates people's perception of situatedness when considering the connection between public displays and their context. We have collected over 300 photos of displays and conducted a set of analysis tasks involving focus groups and structured interviews with 15 participants. The contribution is a consolidated list of situatedness dimensions that should provide a valuable resource for reasoning about situatedness in digital displays and informing the design and development of display systems.",

        "abstract": "The decision-making process and the development of decision support systems (DSS) have been enhanced by a variety of methods originated from information science, cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence over the past years. Situated visualization (SV) is a method to present data representations in context. Its main characteristic is to display data representations near the data referent. As augmented reality (AR) is becoming more mature, affordable and widespread, using it as a tool for SV becomes feasible in several situations. In addition, it may provide a positive contribution to more effective and efficient decision-making, as the users have contextual, relevant and appropriate information to endorse their choices. As new challenges and opportunities arise, it is important to understand the relevance of intertwining these fields. Based on a literature analysis, this paper addresses and discusses current areas of application, benefits, challenges and opportunities of using SV through AR to visualize data in context and to support a decision-making process and its importance in future DSS.",

To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median \u2265 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.",

        "abstract": "When showing data about people, visualization designers and data journalists often use design strategies that presumably help the audience relate to those people. The term anthropographics has been recently coined to refer to this practice and the resulting visualizations. Anthropographics is a rich and growing area, but the work so far has remained scattered. Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of a clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research papers. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics.",

We conducted a two-year design study focused on the creation of a community-based data display using the United States Environmental Protection Agency data on water permit violations by oil storage facilities on the Chelsea Creek in Massachusetts to explore whether situated data physicalization and Participatory Action Research could support meaningful engagement with open data. We selected this data as it is of interest to local groups and available online, yet remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the Chelsea community. The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes. We reflect on the role of community engaged research in the Information Visualization community relative to recent conversations on new approaches to design studies and evaluation.",

        "abstract": " ABSTRACTAugmented reality (AR) enables the creation of immersive situated visualizations. These visualizations blend with the real world so that the user perceives the virtual objects as physically present. We propose two novel immersive situated visualizations for geospatial quantitative point data that link AR bar graphics in the real environment with a virtual AR chart or map. The Egocentric Bar Chart combines virtual bars placed in a real landscape with a virtual 360\u00b0 bar chart arranged around the user. The Circular Map with Bars combines bars in a real landscape with a 360\u00b0 virtual map showing bar graphics. These visualizations are designed for inspecting the location and attributes of individual points, as well as understanding the spatial and non-spatial patterns of a set of points. We conducted a study with 12 participants to evaluate reading accuracy and efficiency of the two visualizations, with a view from a skyscraper at the center of the Melbourne metropolitan area. To better control confounding factors, the study used a virtual environment instead of an AR setup. We found that the two suggested visualizations performed better than bars placed in a landscape, and received positive feedback from study participants. The Egocentric Bar Chart visualization was most accurate when estimating and comparing values, and we identified promising improvements for the Circular Map with Bars visualization. Our results demonstrate the potential of AR technology for the communication of geospatial point data with immersive situated bar graphics in an outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": " This paper investigates the concept of urban visualization, the visual representation of an urban environment through its intrinsic or related data, where its display is also situated within that physical environment. It describes how the principles behind public and urban displays can be combined with those of social visualization and persuasive computing in order to create discursive as well as pictorial representations that provide a better and potentially actionable understanding of urban issues to its inhabitants. We introduce the role of several related research fields, and analyze a set of representative case studies, taken from current best practice, academic research studies, and an experimental design studio course to highlight the typical issues involved in conceptualizing and implementing an urban visualization. Lastly, the paper proposes a set of design constraints that typically characterize an urban visualization, in order to guide the future design and evaluation of useful applications within the field.",

This system was developed to aid in the visual understanding of data from wireless sensors used to monitor large structures. Due to the laborious manual inspections required for large structures (such as bridges), wireless environmental sensors have been designed to automate this process. Our system visualizes this information in its real-world context using the Tinmith mobile outdoor augmented reality system. We provide an overview of the visualizations, outlining a user study that was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the visualizations in providing the user with context-sensitive information, along with the preliminary results of this study.

        "abstract": "Ubiquitous, situated, and physical visualizations create entirely new possibilities for tasks contextualized in the real world, such as doctors inserting needles. During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.",

We explore the design space of shake menus, which are intended for use in tangible augmented reality. Shake menus are radial menus displayed centered on a physical object and activated by shaking that object. One important aspect of their design space is the coordinate system used to present menu options. We conducted a within-subjects user study to compare the speed and efficacy of several alternative methods for presenting shake menus in augmented reality (world-referenced, display-referenced, and object-referenced), along with a baseline technique (a linear menu on a clipboard). Our findings suggest tradeoffs amongst speed, efficacy, and flexibility of interaction, and point towards the possible advantages of hybrid approaches that compose together transformations in different coordinate systems. We close by describing qualitative feedback from use and present several illustrative applications of the technique.",

        "abstract": "When delivering presentations to a co-located audience, we typically use slides with text and 2D graphics to complement the spoken narrative. Though presentations have largely been explored on 2D media, augmented reality (AR) allows presentation designers to add data and augmentations to existing physical infrastructure on display. This coupling could provide a more engaging experience to the audience and support comprehension. With HydrogenAR, we present a novel application that leverages the benefits of data-driven storytelling with those of AR to explain the unique challenges of hydrogen dispenser reliability. Utilizing physical props, situated data, and virtual augmentations and animations, HydrogenAR serves as a unique presentation tool, particularly critical for stakeholders, tour groups, and VIPs. HydrogenAR is a product of multiple collaborative design iterations with a local Hydrogen Fuel research team and is evaluated through interviews with team members and a user study with end-users to evaluate the usability and quality of the interactive AR experience. Through this work, we provide design considerations for AR data-driven presentations and discuss how AR could be used for innovative content delivery beyond traditional slide-based presentations.",

The results identify shortcomings of current approaches and target scenarios and design considerations for future field analysis systems. We embody these findings in FieldView, an extensible, open-source prototype designed to support critical use cases for situated field analysis.

Situated Visualization techniques have several advantages compared to traditional visualization techniques with the biggest advantage being providing the spatial relationship between data and the actual environment. However, Situated Visualization techniques are also subject to several challenges. In particular, Situated Visualization of data from geographic information systems (GIS) is exposed to a set of problems, such as limited visibility, legibility, information clutter and the limited understanding of spatial relationships. In this paper, we address the challenges of visibility, information clutter and understanding of spatial relationships with a set of dynamic Situated Visualization techniques that address the special needs of Situated Visualization of GIS data in particular for \u201cstreet-view\u201d-like perspectives as used for many navigation applications. The proposed techniques include dynamic annotation placement, dynamic label alignment and occlusion culling. We applied those techniques for two types of Situated Visualizations: Augmented Reality visualization and Indirect Augmented Reality using 360 Degree footage.",
